# P3 submission Gayatri and Tarcisius 

How to run the UI and the backend server:

Both the UI and the backend server needs each other to run perfectly. In order to run both of these:

- UI: From the terminal, cd to the directory of the UI (p3-submmission). Once you are in the level of this directory, use <b>npm start</b> (NOTE: For making sure the UI runs, try using <b>npm install</b> first to install all the dependencies inn the package.json)

- Backend Server: We are using Java JDBC and SpringBoot for the Backend. To run it, open the spring_boot_CRUD_project from IntelliJ. Then, open the SpringBootCrudProjectApplication.java (in the src/main/java). Inside this file, you will seee the main method to run the backend server. Run the main method, and you will have the backend server running.

Also, please note, for P3 submission, please use P3-Submission_DatabaseDump.zip as a database setup.

Once you run both the UI and the Backend Server, you will be able to list all the data from the tables we have provided (Seller, Product, and Cart). Also, you can do some simple CRUD operation to the tablees provided. Thank you and have a great day!
